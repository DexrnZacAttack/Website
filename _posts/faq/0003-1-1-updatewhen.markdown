  ## Original Post

  Updating the server is a lengthy process, taking a significant amount of effort from multiple developers. Please be patient.

  It takes on average 1 month for the server to be fully updated and tested with said update, however this can be delayed if there are any major breaking changes.

  When updates are ready for testing, they will become available on the Experimental Server, joined with the IP *test.legacyminigames.xyz*.

  # Current stable version: 1.20.1

  # Current experimental version: 1.20.1
