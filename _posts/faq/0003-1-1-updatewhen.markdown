  ### There is no ETA for when the update will be available yet.

  1.20.3 has been released, the update development process has not begun yet to allow for mods and server software to be fully updated. This is done to both allow players to not have to give up all their mods to play on the server and allow server software on the new version to become stable before we use it.

  ## Original Post

  Updating the server is a lengthy process, taking a significant amount of effort from multiple developers. Please be patient.

  It takes on average 1 month for the server to be fully updated and tested with said update, however this can be delayed if there are any major breaking changes.

  When updates are ready for testing, they will become available on the Experimental Server, joined with the IP *test.legacyminigames.net*.

  # Current stable version: 1.20.1

  # Current experimental version: 1.20.1
