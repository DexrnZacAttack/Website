  Bedrock edition works very different than Java Edition under the hood, this means just Geyser alone is not enough to make LEM playable on bedrock.

  Bedrock edition works very different than Java Edition under the hood, this means just Geyser alone is not enough to make LEM playable on bedrock.

  Many elements, such as the UI, Menus, and Game Mechanics (ladder climb speed, knockback, etc.) need to be accounted for before Bedrock can be fully playable.

  Bedrock support was being experiemented with in the past, but has been put on hold for the time being to focus on more important things. Expect it to get work done on it once ModTools 2 is released.

  However, if you would like to play Battle with the first 3 maps right now, you can play Ultmate_Mario's remake [Here!](https://mcpedl.com/minecraft-battle-minigame-bedrock-map/)
