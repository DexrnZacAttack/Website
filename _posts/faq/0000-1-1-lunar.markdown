  Lunar Client has a tendency to break on LEM a **lot**. It has reached a point where the game is unplayable, and here we have a list of everything it breaks.

  <style>
  h2 {text-align: center;}
  </style>
  ## Current known issues

  1 - In the host menu, the chat and most Vanilla UI elements is not visible, and it is only possible to start the game with /trigger lem.gamecfg at this point.

  2 - Commonly, all entities (Players, Chests, Armor Stands, etc.) fail to render, making them invisible. This makes the game essentially unplayable at this state.

  3 - Many UI elements that use the bossbar to render break, such as the battle banner and panorama.

  ## What you can do

  While you can't play with Lunar Client, you can use alternatives:

  1 - [Console-idated](https://modrinth.com/modpack/console-idated): Console-idated is another modpack that attempts to mimic the look of LCE, and has LEM compatibility with few compromises.

  2 - <u>Vanilla Minecraft</u>: Vanilla Minecraft works fine on LEM with no LEM-specific issues, but Vanilla is very poorly optimized. I recommend anything listed above over Vanilla.
