  ## Current known issues

  1 - In the host menu, the chat and most Vanilla UI elements is not visible, and it is only possible to start the game with /trigger lem.gamecfg at this point.

  2 - Commonly, all entities (Players, Chests, Armor Stands, etc.) fail to render, making them invisible. This makes the game essentially unplayable at this state.

  3 - Many UI elements that use the bossbar to render break, such as the battle banner and panorama.

  ## What you can do

  While you can't play with Lunar Client, you can see our list of compatible Modpacks [here](modpack)
