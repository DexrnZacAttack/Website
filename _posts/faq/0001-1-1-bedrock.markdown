  Bedrock edition works very different than Java Edition under the hood, this means just Geyser alone is not enough to make LEM playable on bedrock.

  Many elements, such as the UI, Menus, and Game Mechanics (ladder climb speed, knockback, etc.) need to be accounted for before Bedrock can be fully playable.

  Bedrock support has been considered, but is low priority compared to other features. There's a good chance of it happening, just a long time away from now.

  However, if you would like to play Battle with the first 3 maps right now, you can play Ultmate_Mario's remake [Here!](https://mcpedl.com/minecraft-battle-minigame-bedrock-map/)
