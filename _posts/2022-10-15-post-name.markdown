layout: post
title: "Your post title"
image: /assets/post-image-placeholder.png
permalink: /blog/link-to-your-post
main-text: | 
	This is a sample post!
	
	You can add multiple lines with a pipe, like I did with this one.
	If your post only has a single line (generally HTML posts), use quotes (like the title variable).
	
	You can also use HTML instead of markdown by setting the `markdown` variable to `false`.
	Not setting it or setting it to a non-false value will keep markdown enabled.
	
	Post names also have naming conventions:
	YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.markdown
	
	I suggest all posts have the variables `title`, `image` and `main-text`. `layout` is required and should always be set to `post`.
	`permalink` is also required. `markdown` is not required, and not setting it will set it automatically to `true`.
markdown: true
