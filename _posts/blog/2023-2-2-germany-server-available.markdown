  A new battle server located in Germany is now available!

  The IP for this germany server is **germany.legacyminigames.xyz**

  ### Massive thanks for [strich3](https://github.com/strich3) for providing the server hosting!

  If you have connection issues with the main US server, this server located in Germany might be for you.

  There are 2 ways to connect:
  
  1. Joining the server address **germany.legacyminigames.xyz** (Recommended!)

  2. using /server battle_germany from the US server

  **Note:** using /server will not address ping related problems! Only use this if connecting directly proves to be too unstable.

  If you have issues connecting to the US servers, using /server from the Germany server might improve connection stability
