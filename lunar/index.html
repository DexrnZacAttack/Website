            <p style="font-size:1.80vh">Lunar Client has a tendency to break on LEM a <b>lot</b>. It has reached a point where the game is unplayable, and here we have a list of everything it breaks.</p>
            <p style="line-height:6vh"><cy></cy></p>
            --- Current known issues ---
                <br><label style="font-size: 0.5em">1 - In the host menu, the chat at most Vanilla UI elements is not visible, and it is only possible to start the game with /trigger 4j.gamecfg at this point.<br>
                    2 - Commonly, all entities (Players, Chests, Armor Stands, etc.) fail to render, making them invisible. This makes the game essentially unplayable at this state.<br>
                    3 - Many UI elements that use the bossbar to render break, such as the battle banner and panorama.</label><br><br>
                    --- What you can do ---<br><label style="font-size: 0.5em">
                        While you can't play with Lunar Client, you can use alternatives:<br>
1 - <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacy_console_experience" target='_blank'><b>Legacy Console Experience</b></a>: Legacy Console Experience is a modpack that emulates the look of LCE, and has perfect LEM compatibility without compromises.<br>
3 - <a href="https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions" target='_blank'><b>Fabulously Optimized</b></a>: FO is a modpack designed to improve the performance of Minecraft significantly and works pretty well with LEM, but adds a shadow to the hotbar UI.<br>
4 - <a href="https://optifine.net/home" target='_blank'><b>OptiFine</b></a>: OF is a mod designed to optimize the game, but is not the most preferable to use on LEM and can cause issues to other mods as well.<br>
5 - Vanilla Minecraft: Vanilla Minecraft works fine on LEM with no LEM-specific issues, but Vanilla is very poorly optimized. I do recommend anything listed above over Vanilla.<br>
