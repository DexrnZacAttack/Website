<div class="guibox center">
  <h1>LEM is under hiatus.</h1>

  <p><strong>The server is temporarily unavailable.</strong></p>
  <p>This is being done due to this place not being ready at all for the attention it has received, this has resulted in a massive lack of proper moderation nor a system to properly handle it.</p>
  <p>When the project goes public again expect rules to be enforced way more strictly, Toxicity and such will not be handled as leniently as it is now. If you plan on returning later please keep this in mind.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens now?</strong></p>
  <p>The Discord and Minecraft servers are currently closed, they will be reopened once the hiatus is over.</p>
  <p>Development of the project <b>will not be stopped</b>, this is just to properly prepare this server for actual community management and more stable code. In its current state it lacks any real community management and the code is still very buggy.</p>
  <p><strong>There is no ETA for when the hiatus will be over.</strong></p>
