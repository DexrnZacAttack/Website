            <h1>Lunar Client</h1>
            Lunar Client has a tendency to break on LEM a <b>lot</b>. It has reached a point where the game is unplayable, and here we have a list of everything it breaks.</p>
            <h2>Current known issues</h2>
                1 - In the host menu, the chat at most Vanilla UI elements is not visible, and it is only possible to start the game with /trigger 4j.gamecfg at this point.<br></br>
                2 - Commonly, all entities (Players, Chests, Armor Stands, etc.) fail to render, making them invisible. This makes the game essentially unplayable at this state.<br></br>
                3 - Many UI elements that use the bossbar to render break, such as the battle banner and panorama.
            <h2>What you can do</h2>
                While you can't play with Lunar Client, you can use alternatives:<br></br>
				1 - <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/legacy_console_experience" target='_blank'><b>Legacy Console Experience</b></a>: Legacy Console Experience is a modpack that emulates the look of LCE, and has perfect LEM compatibility without compromises.<br></br>
				2 - <a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/console-idated" target='_blank'><b>Console-idated</b></a>: Console-idated is another modpack that attempts to mimic the look of LCE, and has LEM compatibility with few compromises.<br></br>
				3 - <a href="https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/install-instructions" target='_blank'><b>Fabulously Optimized</b></a>: FO is a modpack designed to improve the performance of Minecraft significantly and works pretty well with LEM, but adds a shadow to the hotbar UI.<br></br>
				4 - <a href="https://optifine.net/home" target='_blank'><b>OptiFine</b></a>: OF is a mod designed to optimize the game, but is not the most preferable to use on LEM and can cause issues to other mods as well.<br></br>
				5 - <b>Vanilla Minecraft</b>: Vanilla Minecraft works fine on LEM with no LEM-specific issues, but Vanilla is very poorly optimized. I recommend anything listed above over Vanilla.
